\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This paper is about improving the runtime of jajapy - a tool for estimating parameters in parametric models.




%TODO: Add to acronyms
Markov Chain (MC) - A chain of events described as a sequence of events without knowledge of prior.
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - A markov chain with emission probabilities.
Markov Decision Process (MDP) - A markov chain with actions that influence the transitions.
Continuous Time Markov Chain - A markov chain with traces that have dwell times as well as label emissions.
Baum-Welch algorithm (BW) - Expectation-Maximization algorithm for finding the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model.
Algebraic Decision Diagram (ADD) - A data structure of states and binary decisions, also called a Multi-Terminal Binary Decision Diagram (MTBDD).

%TODO: Add the formal definitions for all the markovian models
% Use the definition LaTeX environment, and base the definitions off of Raphaels paper.
