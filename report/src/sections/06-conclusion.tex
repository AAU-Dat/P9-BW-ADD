\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have attempted to develop and test a symbolic implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm.
Although the implementation is almost complete, experiments have not yet been conducted.
As such, it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on results.
However, an error has been found in prior work~\cite{p7} in the forward step, indicating that a symbolic implementation has even better runtime than initially thought.

We have made small steps toward an entirely symbolic implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm for \glspl{hmm}.
We have also described the necessary matrix calculation representations, most of which are remarkably similar to Markov Chains.

We know that the Kronecker product is implementable in \gls{cudd} from~\cite{davidkebo-kronecker}, and by extension, the Khatri-Rao product should be equally possible.
Unfortunately, our attempts so far have been unsuccessful.
