        The Baum-Welch algorithm is a cornerstone of parameter estimation for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are widely used in fields such as speech recognition and bioinformatics.
        Traditional implementations rely on matrix operations, which scale poorly for large models due to quadratic space complexity.
        This paper introduces the framework for an entirely symbolic implementation of the Baum-Welch algorithm using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs).
        By employing ADDs throughout the algorithm --- including forward-backward computations and parameter updates --- we expect a significant potential reduction in memory requirements and improved scalability.
        This approach leverages symbolic computation to minimize overhead from explicit state space representations, paving the way for efficient parameter estimation in complex systems.
        Preliminary findings and challenges in integrating this symbolic framework with tools like the Storm model checker are discussed.
